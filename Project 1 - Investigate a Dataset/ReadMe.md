# Project 1 - Investigate a Dataset

### Project Overview
In this project, I will be analyzing a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I will be use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

### What have I learnt?
After completing the project, you will:

* Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
* Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
* Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format I can use
* Have practice communicating the results of my analysis
* Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up my data analysis code
* Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which lets me access your data more conveniently
* Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing my findings

### Project Details
For this project, I have chosen the "Titanic Passengers" data set from Kaggle.com.
Went through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing my findings.
