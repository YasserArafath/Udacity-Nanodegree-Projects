### Project Overview
I have chosen an area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world. Finally, I will be using SQL as the data schema to complete my project.

### What will I learn?
After completing the project, I will be able to:

* Assess the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity.
* Parse and gather data from popular file formats such as .csv, .json, .xml, and .html
* Process data from multiple files or very large files that can be cleaned programmatically.
* Learn how to store, query, and aggregate data using MongoDB or SQL.

### Project Details
The place chosen by me was Ottawa, Canada. Since the data set was huge, I created a small sample data set from the original data set to make things easier.
