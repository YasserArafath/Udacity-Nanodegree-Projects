# Udacity-Nanodegree-Projects
These are the various projects I had done for my Nanodegree on Data Analyst

# Project 1 : Investigate a Dataset
Choosing one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Going through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing my findings.


# Project 2 : Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data
Chose an area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and used data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world. Chose to learn SQL and apply the chosen schema to the project.


# Project 3 : Exploratory Data Analysis
Used R and applied exploratory data analysis techniques to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.


# Project 4 : Identify Fraud from Enron Email
Played detective and put my machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.


# Project 5 : Make Effective Data Visualization
Created a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the data. Used d3.js to create the visualization. It is a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
