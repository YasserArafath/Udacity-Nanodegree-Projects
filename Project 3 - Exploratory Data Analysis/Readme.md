### Project Overview
In this project, R and exploratory data analysis techniques will be used to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

### What will I learn?
After completing the project, I will be able to:

* Understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers
* Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set by using appropriate plots such as scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and box plots
* Explore variables to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models; calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means
* Learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables, such as reshaping data frames and using aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information

### Project Details
In this project, I will conduct your own exploratory data analysis using R Studio & R language and create an RMD file that explores the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships of a data set of your choice.
