# Project 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis

### Project Overview
In this project, R and exploratory data analysis techniques will be used to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

### What will I learn?
After completing the project, I will be able to:

* Understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers
* Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set by using appropriate plots such as scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and box plots
* Explore variables to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models; calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means
* Learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables, such as reshaping data frames and using aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information

### Project Details
In this project, I will conduct your own exploratory data analysis using R Studio & R language and create an RMD file that explores the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships of a data set of my choice.

The dataset is from the US FARS (Fatality Analysis Recording System) archive that is intended to include every accident in which there was at least one fatality. Data are limited to vehicles where the front seat passenger seat was occupied.
