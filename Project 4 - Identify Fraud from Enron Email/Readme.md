### Project Overview
In this project, I will put your machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

### What will I learn?
By the end of the project, I will be able to:

* Deal with an imperfect, real-world dataset
* Validate a machine learning result using test data
* Evaluate a machine learning result using quantitative metrics
* Create, select and transform features
* Compare the performance of machine learning algorithms
* Tune machine learning algorithms for maximum performance
* Communicate your machine learning algorithm results clearly

### Project Details
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. In this project, I will play detective, and put my new skills to use by building a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal.

The starter code is provided, that reads in the data, takes your features of choice, then puts them into a numpy array, which is the input form that most sklearn functions assume. With the help of that, I had engineered the features, picked and tuned an algorithm, and tested and evaluateed my identifier.
