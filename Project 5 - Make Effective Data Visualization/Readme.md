### Project Overview
To create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the data. I will be using d3.js to create the visualization. This project will be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

### What will I learn?
After completing the project, I will be able to:

* Demonstrate the ability to choose optimal visual elements to encode data and critically assess the effectiveness of the visualization
* Communicate a story or finding to the appropriate audience using interactive visualizations
* Undergo the iterative process of creating a visualization, and build interactive visualizations with dimple.js or d3.js.

### Project Details
First, a dataset is chosen and it is cleaned & analysed using R.

The following files are created : 

* an index.html file containing the code to create the visualization
* an index_final.html file containing the code to the final visualization after the feedback
* a README.md file that includes 3 sections...
  Summary - A brief introduction to my data visualization that can help readers understand it
  Design - The design choices made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback
  Feedback - All feedbacks received from others on my visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization

* data files
  the data set used to create the visualization (.csv file)

*Note: The "index_final.html" will be viewable only if D3 javascript library is added to the browser.
